In addition, FourSquare data will be used to identify cities with similar surrounding venues.\n\nThe following data sources will be used:\n<li> City Quality of Life Dataset (from Teleport.org) </li>\n<li> FourSquare location data, and venue information </li>\n\nWe will use the Quality of Life dataset identify similar rated cities (through the use of DBSCAN CLustering). Next we will use FourSquare venue data from the city centre - which will be used to identify the most similar cities from the quality of life cluster.\n\n<h4> City Quality of Life Dataset </h4>\nThe quality of life is identified by several unique scores (housing, cost of living, startups, venture capital, travel connectivity, commute, business freedom, safety, healthcare, education, environmental quality, economy, taxation and internet access). By taking an average of the following scores:\n<li> Cost of living </li>\n<li> Startups </li>\n<li> Travel Connectivity </li>\n<li> Business Freedom </li>\n<li> Economy </li>\n<li> Taxation </li>\nUsing the above indicies, a clustering technique (DBSCAN or SVM) will be used to identify cities similar to the clients input option.\n\n<h4> FourSquare Data </h4>\nThe FourSquare data will be used to identify the top options from the identified Quality of Life city.\nThis will also be selected using an un-supervised classification method.\n\n<h4> Example Data </h4>\nThe Quality of Life Dataset could identify cities whose residents value similar lifestyle qualities.\n\nFollowing this, we will have a list of cities that we can then compare based on similar popular venue types."
